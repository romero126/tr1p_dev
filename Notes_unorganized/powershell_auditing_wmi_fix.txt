Enable PowerShell module and script block logging (optional)
The following steps enable logging for all PowerShell actions on your system. PowerShell Module Logging is not required for JEA, however it is strongly recommended that you turn it on to ensure the commands users run are logged in a central location.

You can configure the PowerShell Module Logging policy using Group Policy.

Open the Local Group Policy Editor on a workstation or a Group Policy Object in the Group Policy Management Console on an Active Directory Domain Controller
Navigate to Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows PowerShell
Double click on Turn on Module Logging
Click Enabled
In the Options section, click on Show next to Module Names
Type "\*" in the pop up window. This instructs PowerShell to log commands from all modules.
Click OK to set the policy
Double click on Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging
Click Enabled
Click OK to set the policy
(On domain-joined machines only) Run gpupdate or wait for Group Policy to process the updated policy and apply the settings
You can also enable system-wide PowerShell transcription through Group Policy.
